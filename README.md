# Cat Model Website

A stylish portfolio site showcasing model-inspired cat portraits, built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The site features bilingual navigation (English/French), smooth scrolling, lazy image loading, and a fully responsive layout for optimal performance and user experience across all devices.

All photos were captured and retouched by me, demonstrating both my photography skills and frontend development expertise.
